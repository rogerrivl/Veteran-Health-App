Each time we begin working on a new issue, please be sure to look on the right-hand side menu -> under Development create a new branch and then in your terminal git fetch origin -> git checkout -branch name-

We will be using Javascript for our React Frontend

# To start up APP (Follow instructions here)

- CD frontend
- npm install
- amplify init > dev > profiles > select your profile -- look up documentation on how to setup an amplify dev environment on your machine
- npm start

## Material UI

# Git Best Practices

Ensure to commit work done regularly to not lose any work done

Ensure to git fetch and git pull regularly to ensure you are working with the most recent version of code 
this is especially important each time that we merge a branch into main.

Each time that we merge into main and you are still working on an issue -> git fetch origin -> git checkout main -> git pull -> git checkout -your current branch- -> git merge main -> resolve any potential merge conflicts or reach out for assistance

Please reach out to team members if anything comes up or you have any blockers (things keeping you from working on your issue)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `cd frontend`

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
